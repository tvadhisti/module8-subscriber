### Reflection 1
a. what is amqp?

AMQP stands for Advanced Message Queuing Protocol. It's a way for different computer programs to send messages to each other without needing to connect directly. This protocol defines a set of rules for how messages should be formatted and exchanged between systems. 

b. what it means? guest:guest@localhost:5672

- The first "guest" is like a username we use to log into a website.

- The second "guest" is like a password that goes with the username.

- localhost:5672 specifies the network address and port on which the AMQP server is running:
  
&emsp; • localhost indicates that the server is hosted on the same computer as the client software.

&emsp; • 5672 is the standard port number used for non-encrypted communication with an AMQP server.

This string is commonly used in configurations and scripts to establish a connection to an AMQP server with default credentials and settings.
